Introduction

Rollups on the Ethereum network are gaining traction, indicating a new phase in the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. However, as the ecosystem continues to evolve towards a rollup-centric roadmap, it confronts new challenges such as state and liquidity fragmentation and extended finality time.

In order to solve this problem, the Nuffle Fast Finality Layer (NFFL, formerly SFFL) was designed. Through it, various chains can, while supplying block data to **NEAR DA**, rely on the economic security of an **EigenLayer AVS** to provide a faster block finality to various protocols and use-cases while also including an additional public DA layer into their stack.

This universal, secure and fast finality leads to major advancements in interoperability protocols, enabling or improving designs such as general bridging and chain abstraction.

For more details, refer to the Documentation. NFFL is under active development and is not yet available on any publicly accessible environments.
